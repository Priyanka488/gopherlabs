Go PlayGround:-(https://play.golang.org/p/-N_yGtploWl)

- A complete program is created by linking a single, unimported package called the main package with all the packages it imports, transitively. The main package must have package name main and declare a function main that takes no arguments and returns no value.

    func main() { â€¦ }

- Program execution begins by initializing the main package and then invoking the function main. When that function invocation returns, the program exits. It does not wait for other (non-main) goroutines to complete.

- Go: Meaning of the 'fmt' package acronym
- fmt is short for format. 
-  Package fmt implements formatted I/O with functions analogous to C's printf and scanf. The format 'verbs' are derived from    C's but are simpler.
